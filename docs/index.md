# CHBH Computing on Bear

CHBH-on-BEAR extends the [Bear Technical Documentation](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/) pages tutorials and examples for neuroimaging analyses to run on BlueBEAR.

Sections are organised by core neuroimaging software packages. Practical examples and explanations are provided where possible.

Check out the links in the sidebar to get started. Try 'Getting Started' if you're a new user or jump into a specific software if you already have some experience with BEAR computing.
